### How Large Language Models Map Infinite Worlds Using Fractal-Shaped Narratives in Higher Dimensions

Hey!

First and foremost, do read the title properly. It's a hypothesis.

Secondly, take a deep breath and read the description below the title again.


Good. So.. lets begin..


This blog series explores a central idea: that large language models (LLMs) leverage fractal-like structures within narratives to construct internal world models.

The hypothesis we will explore is that: LLMs don’t just process sequences of text; they model branching possibilities that resemble a structured multiverse of fractal shaped narratives in higher dimensions, which is akin to a simulated world.

Our goal together in this series will be to see how many of these dots are already out there, waiting to be seen and connected. But the journey is long, and unless you have all the priors and papers, it seems like it is not easy to connect them.  And that is the gap this series is gonna fill.

A higher dimension is worth many many lower dimensions, so here are few images for your vision cortex

1. Between the input of context and next token lies a universe of possibilities

2. Language spread out in latent space as fractal

3. Imagine now, (1) and (2) together… The context on the left when coming in contact with the tensor operations, goes via these unfathomably large space of narratives or storylines and finally ends up converging back to a prediction of coherent token


No more.. This was a short introduction, because I can't write all of this in one go and there are shit ton of papers we will have to refer and relate..so stay tuned.
