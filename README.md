# God of Stories Hypothesis

### How Large Language Models Map Infinite Worlds Using Fractal-Shaped Narratives in Higher Dimensions

Hey!

First and foremost, do read the title properly. It's a hypothesis.

Secondly, take a deep breath and read the description below the title again.

This post series will explore a central idea: that large language models (LLMs) leverage fractal-like structures within narratives to construct internal world models.

The hypothesis we will explore is that: LLMs donâ€™t just process sequences of text; they model branching possibilities that resemble a structured multiverse of fractal shaped narratives in higher dimensions, which is akin to a simulated world.

Our goal together in this series will be to see how many of these dots are already out there, waiting to be seen and connected. But the journey is long, and unless you have all the priors and papers, it seems like it is not easy to connect them.  And that is the gap this series is gonna fill.

No more.. This was a short introduction, because I can't write all of this in one go and there are shit ton of papers we will have to refer and relate..so stay tuned.

NOTE: Section links will be added here in this readme itself
